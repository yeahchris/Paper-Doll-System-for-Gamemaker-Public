# Paper Doll System for GameMaker

**Paper Doll System for GameMaker** is... a paper doll system for GameMaker.

Using this system, animations can assembled entirely through code and are animated from **unsliced sprite sheets**.

Assemble animations using any frame from any region of a sprite sheet, arbitrarily mirror frames, and specify a custom duration (in either milliseconds or game frames) for each animation frame — all with just a few lines of code.

Sprite sheet templates can be created via a function call without editing any code. The system is (in theory) compatible with any grid-based sprite sheet that has a consistent layout.

The system integrates with (and is bundled with) **Pixelated Pope’s RetroPaletteSwapper**, allowing arbitrary palette swaps of individual paper doll parts.

There is a demo project included in the repository, but it uses free assets, and does not demonstrate palette swapping of paper doll layers. There is also a video demo below:
